### general foreword

PACE has been standardized by [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de) to provide a secure channel establishment mechanism providing provable security with low-entropy PINs or passwords. It serves as a replacement for Basic Access Control (BAC) known from international travel passports. If you are a security researcher with mathematical background and interested in the security properties of PACE please see the "Security Analysis of the PACE Key-Agreement Protocol" publication linked above. The following explanation is a purely technical view.

### basic assumptions

* PACE defines a so-called general mapping (GM), integrated mapping (IM) and chip authentication mapping (CAM)
  GM means diffie-hellman key-exchanges should be used to agree on cryptographic parameters, IM describes a patented mechanism without reyling on DH and CAM is more sophiscated     variant mainly to be used in national ID documents.
  
* We'll focus on general mapping with elliptic curve diffie-hellman here, because this variant is also publicly available  

excerpt from public JC3.0.5 API docs:
"Elliptic curve Generic Mapping according to TR03110 v2. Performs the s * G + H calculation, where s is provided as EC private key private value, G is provided as base point of the private key object and H is passed as public data in the generateSecret() method."
