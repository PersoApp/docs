### general foreword

PACE has been standardized by [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de) to provide a secure channel establishment mechanism providing provable security with low-entropy PINs or passwords. It serves as a replacement for Basic Access Control (BAC) known from international travel passports. If you are a security researcher with mathematical background and interested in the security properties of PACE please see the "Security Analysis of the PACE Key-Agreement Protocol" publication linked above. The following explanation is a purely technical view.

### basic assumptions

* PACE defines a so-called general mapping (GM), integrated mapping (IM) and chip authentication mapping (CAM)
  GM means diffie-hellman key-exchanges should be used to agree on cryptographic parameters, IM describes a patented mechanism without reyling on DH and CAM is more sophiscated     variant mainly to be used in national ID documents.
  
* We'll focus on general mapping with elliptic curve diffie-hellman here, because this variant is also publicly available in JavaCard or easy implentable on freely programmable cards like [BasicCard](http://www.basiccard.com/)

* The secure messaging part itself (usualy AES-128-CBC-CMAC8) is _NOT_ part of PACE itself, even when normative references typically declare combinations of PACE and secure messaging combinations.

* In practice we're not dealing with PINs and passwords directly and don't store such secrets in the chip.
#### In general lets make the assumption PACE_nonce_AES128key = SHA-1(usersecret)[0 .. 15].

excerpt from public JC3.0.5 API docs:
"Elliptic curve Generic Mapping according to TR03110 v2. Performs the s * G + H calculation, where s is provided as EC private key private value, G is provided as base point of the private key object and H is passed as public data in the generateSecret() method."

### protocol flow overview

01) the host requests a cards resource, the card declines because of missing authentication.
02) the host requests PACE for authentication, possibly giving a preference 
03) the card responds with a 128-bit (16 byte) random number (nonce) encrypted with PACE_nonce_AES128key
04) the host decrypts the 128-bit nonce with PACE_nonce_AES128key derived from user input as described above
05) the host calculates G' as G * nonce, i.e. using nonce as private key and calculating the corresponding public key (use keyAgreement Plain with G as public point and nonce as own secret)
06) the host uses G' as base for a classic ECDH and sends the resulting public key to the card
07) the card uses the previously chosen nonce to calculate G' and processes the classic ECDH with the host public key and stores the result as H (could already calculate G'' = G'+H)
08) the card sends its own G'-ECDH based public key to the host
09) the host processes the cards public key with the G'-ECDH and generates H
10) the host adds G' and H and sets them as new G'' for the second ECDH and generates a new public key and sends it to the card
11) the card processes the hosts public key as G''-ECDH and calculates S, generates its own second public key and sends it to the host
12) the host process the second public key from the card with G''-ECDH and calculates S
13) the x-coordinate of S is the input for the counter-KDF to create secure messaging keys for encrypt and MAC
14) secure messaging is established, authentication tokens are exchanged and verified if used in protocol
15) application layer communication takes places on a secured and authenticated channel
